# Teacher Distribution Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project led by a Data Analyst aimed to analyze the distribution of teachers across government, private, and other sectors within a specific state. The analysis involved determining the optimal number of teachers required for each sector, considering factors such as gender and professional status. Pivot tables in Excel were utilized to efficiently organize and analyze large datasets containing information on teachers from various sectors. Insights into teacher distribution based on gender and professional status across different sectors were generated using pivot tables. Detailed analysis using pivot tables was conducted to identify trends and patterns in teacher allocation within the specific state. Finally, the insights generated through pivot tables were presented through visualizations and reports.
